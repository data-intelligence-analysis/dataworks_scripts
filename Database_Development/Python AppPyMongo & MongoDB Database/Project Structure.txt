Read File into JSON-style list
    1. MongoDB Community Edition: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
    2. pip install PyMongo
    3. Python Stores Documents in json format
    4. We will prepare a JSON-style List to later insert into the Collection of documents
    5. Read data from comma separated file
    6. Save it in the List as word, definition pairs: {'word':'cryptc','definition':'secret with a hidden meaning'}

Create Database
    1. Create database using connection string URL
    2. Name the database
    3. If no database exists, MongoDB creates one 
    4. Use database connection to create the Collection
    5. Check the database for existence

Insert documents (records) into the collection
    1. Insert a single document. JSON formatted document
    2. Providing an _id for insert is optional. MongoDB assigns one upon insert.
    3. Check the result object for inserted id.
    4. Insert Many Documents.
    5. Check the result for inserted ids

Query collection
    1. Use the find_one to retrieve one document from the collection.
    2. Returns the _id, word and definition as JSON.
    3. Use find to return many documents.
    4. Use exclusion to only get certain fields from the query.
    5. Use filter to select only certain documents.

Task 5: Update the collection
    1. Update a single document in the Collection.
    2. Check the modified count.
    3. Update all documents in the Collection.
    4. Check the modified count.
    5. Query the collection and print it.
