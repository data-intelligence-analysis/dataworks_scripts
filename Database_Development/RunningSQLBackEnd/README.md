# <u>Student Application</u>

A student application that is to be used by a hypothetical training institution. This hypothetical institution offers various courses that the student can enroll in. A uniqued identifier, like an Id, is assigned to the name of the courses (courseid, coursename) to indentify the course and the data would be transformed into a table and essential create a database that can be interogatted using sqlite. A course can have unlimited students as well. Just like the development of the course table, the application will develop a student table, containing a unique identifier that is assigned to the student name (studentid, studentname) that will share a relationship with the course table and ultimately create a relational database. Therefore, students can enroll in one or more courses, however, a student may choose not to enroll in any courses.
