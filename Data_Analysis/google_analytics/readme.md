## Meet the Instructor

Welcome to this course on How to Use Segments in Google Analytics for Deeper Analysis! I have used Google Analytics for my sites as well as for my clients. I am still amazed how much data is contained within Google Analytics and how that can be used to tell me more about website audiences. Segments is one of those 'features' in Google Analytics that really helps us go deeper into the data to discover more about our website audiences. I am sure you will discover the same as you complete this project.
